I like Disney movies and the screen of my laptop is Disney princesses. I visited the Disney World in Orlando last winter break
and it was awesome! There are many wonderful rides there and my favorite one is the Avatar. I love that one and I plan to 
visit the Disney World again this thanks-giving break! And the fireworks were wonderful and magical!
